-- lazygit integration
-- plugin lazy-loads on commands (LazyGit, LazyGitConfig, LazyGitCurrentFile, LazyGitFilter, LazyGitFilterCurrentFile)
-- and is mainly controlled via the <leader>gg keymap in lua/config/keymaps.lua.

-- no extra lua setup needed here for now; this file exists
-- to keep the \"one plugin per file\" layout consistent.
